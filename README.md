## About this page

In this page I intend to summarise the usage of structural MRI workflows to estimate gray matter density (GMD) and cortical thickness (CT) from T1-weighted MRI volumes and carry out analyses to answer interesting research questions. My main interest here is to provide a detailed tutorial on CIVET (Montreal Neurological Institute) and RMINC (https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre/RMINC) to estimate vertex-based individual cortical thickness and later carry out group comparisons and correlations. However,I will also try to describe -- with lesser detail -- the usage of FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) for Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analyses and FreeSurfer (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) for CT analyses, especially with an aim towards doing custum region of interest (ROI) analysis.

## Dataset

For the examples we will be using the Empathic Response in Psychotherapists dataset, generated by [Olalde-Mathieu et al. (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182998v2) and the structural analysis of which were carried out in [Dom√≠nguez-Arriola et al. (2021)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.425096v2). In the link provided you can download the structural volumes as well as the behavioral and demographic information.

## CIVET

[CIVET](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/CIVET-2-1-0-Introduction) is an sMRI processing pipeline developed by The McConnell Brain Imaging Centre to more reliably extract individual cortical surfaces at the vertex-level and estimate cortical thickness in milimeters at each point of the brain cortex. Several definitions of cortical thickness are available to use in the pipeline, and users will be available to choose the one they think is most appropritate. However, there is evidence that the linked-distance definition is more accurate and reliable than other geometric cortical-thickness definitions (Lerch & Evans, 2005). 

### Preprocessing

Users could simply feed the raw volumes to the pipeline; however, I recommend customizing the preprocessing of the volumes to ensure the best quality and most accurate results. This will consist in:

* A qualitative quality control of the volumes.
* [N4 Bias Correction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3071855/), and formatting file names.
* Generation of individual brain masks using [volBrain 1.0](https://volbrain.upv.es/).

#### Quality Control 

See Backhausen et al. (2016)

#### N4 Bias Field Correction and formatting file names

First, in order to run the *N4BiasFieldCorrection* algorithm ([ANTS](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) must be installed) you have to go to the folder where your NIFTI files are and, if you wanted to preprocess one file, run for instance: 

```bash
N4BiasFieldCorrection -d 3 -i sub-1000_ses-1_T1w.nii.gz -o sub-1000_n4.nii.gz
```
where -d specifies the image dimensionality, -i the input and -o the output name. Of course, we would ideally not want to process the volumes one by one, and would like to have the resulting volume in a dedicated directory. We may use a for loop for the former:

```bash
mkdir n4_corrected_output

for nii in *.nii.gz; do
        id=`echo $nii | cut -d "_" -f 1` #extract subject ID
        N4BiasFieldCorrection -d 3 -i $nii -o n4_corrected_output/${id}_n4.nii.gz #Perform correction
done
```

Finally, for the T1 volumes to be ready for the CIVET pipeline, they need to be transformed into MINC files and have a specific pattern in their names; so each file should look something like this: *PREFIX_ID_t1.mnc*, where __PREFIX__ is the study prefix (whichever we want it to be as long as it is consistently used throughout the whole workflow), __ID__ is the indivual volume's identifier, __t1__ tells CIVET that this is a T1-weighted MRI volume that needs processing, and __.mnc__ because it is a MINC file (not NIFTI anymore). For instance, here I would like to use the prefix **TA** and, so, my subject **sub-1000** should look something like this: *TA_1000_t1.mnc*. 

Let's do this in code. Suppose we are in the same directory as before -- i.e where the NIFTI files are, and where we now have a *n4_corrrected_output* folder filled with volumes. For the sake of tidyness I will move all the old NIFTI files to a new directory (since they are no longer useful; but we want them at hand as a backup) and I will create a new directory for the propperly formatted MINC volumes (note that you need to have the [MINC Toolkit](https://bic-mni.github.io/) installed -- or a virtual machine with it): 

```bash
mkdir NIFTI
mv *.nii.gz NIFTI

mkdir mnc_files

for nii in $(ls n4_corrected_output); do
        id=`echo $nii | cut -d "_" -f 1` #extract subject ID
        nii2mnc $nii mnc_files/TA_${id}_t1.mnc
done
```
