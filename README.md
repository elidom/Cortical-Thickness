## About this page

In this page I intend to summarise the usage of structural MRI workflows to estimate gray matter density (GMD) and cortical thickness (CT) from T1-weighted MRI volumes and carry out analyses to answer interesting research questions. My main interest here is to provide a detailed tutorial on CIVET (Montreal Neurological Institute) and RMINC (https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre/RMINC) to estimate vertex-based individual cortical thickness and later carry out group comparisons and correlations. However,I will also try to describe -- with lesser detail -- the usage of FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) for Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analyses and FreeSurfer (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) for CT analyses, especially with an aim towards doing custum region of interest (ROI) analysis.

## Dataset

For the examples we will be using the Empathic Response in Psychotherapists dataset, generated by [Olalde-Mathieu et al. (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182998v2) and the structural analysis of which were carried out in [Dom√≠nguez-Arriola et al. (2021)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.425096v2). In the link provided you can download the structural volumes as well as the behavioral and demographic information.

## CIVET

[CIVET](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/CIVET-2-1-0-Introduction) is an sMRI processing pipeline developed by The McConnell Brain Imaging Centre to more reliably extract individual cortical surfaces at the vertex-level and estimate cortical thickness in milimeters at each point of the brain cortex. Several definitions of cortical thickness are available to use in the pipeline, and users will be available to choose the one they think is most appropritate. However, there is evidence that the linked-distance definition is more accurate and reliable than other geometric cortical-thickness definitions (Lerch & Evans, 2005). 

### Preprocessing

Users could simply feed the raw volumes to the pipeline; however, I recommend customizing the preprocessing of the volumes to ensure the best quality and most accurate results. This will consist in:

* A qualitative quality control of the volumes.
* [N4 Bias Correction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3071855/) to correct for noise and field inhomogeneities.
* Generation of individual brain masks using [volBrain 1.0](https://volbrain.upv.es/).
